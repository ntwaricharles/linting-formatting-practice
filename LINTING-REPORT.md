## Initial Linting Errors

After running ESLint for the first time, the following linting errors were found:

### TypeScript Files
1. **Quotes Rule Violation**: Double quotes used instead of single quotes in several files.
   - **Solution**: Replaced all double quotes with single quotes according to the rule `"quotes": ["error", "single"]`.

2. **No Console Log Rule Violation**: `console.log()` found in `example.component.ts`.
   - **Solution**: Removed the `console.log()` to adhere to the `no-console` rule.

3. **Strict Equality**: Non-strict equality (`==`) used in the `app.component.ts`.
   - **Solution**: Replaced `==` with `===` as per the `eqeqeq` rule.

### HTML Files
1. **Template Errors**: Improper indentation in HTML files.
   - **Solution**: Reformatted all HTML files using Prettier.

## Post-Fix Results

After manually fixing the errors and formatting the code, I re-ran ESLint and no errors or warnings were reported.
